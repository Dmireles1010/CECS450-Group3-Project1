                        NARRATOR
              According to all known laws of aviation,
              there is no way that a bee should
              be able to fly. Its wings are too
              small to get its fat little body off
              the ground. The bee, of course, flies
              anyway because bees don't care what
              humans think is impossible. cut to

              Your father paid good money for those.

              dodges the flyswatter, but then hit
              by the boot and again by all three,

              from two cans. He signals he's okay,

              him together. He signals he's still
              okay by poking his arm up through

                        TRUDY
              Of course. Most bee jobs are small
              ones. But bees know that every small
              job, if it's done well, means a lot.
              But choose carefully because you'll
              stay in the job that you pick for

              What's the difference?

                        TRUDY
              And you'll be happy to know that bees,
              as a species, haven't had one day

              So you'll just work us to death?

              We'll sure try.

              uncomfortable. The tram converts into

              at Barry. Barry screams at her. Everyone
              except the young girl screams back.)

              Hi, bee.

              hair spray and sprays it on Barry)

                        BARRY
              Wow... the tension level out here
              is unbelievable. I gotta get home.

              close and fast) Woah. (Barry sees

              him, but before he can recover, another
              hits him) Mayday! Mayday! Bee going

              makes it there, then crawls through

              I made it into a fold-out brochure.

              Oh, no. More humans. I don't need
              this. (tries to fly out the window
              but bounces off of it) Oof! Ow! What
              was that? (tries again) Maybe this
              time. This time. This time. This time!
              This time! This, this, this, this...

              out. (flies towards the light near
              the ceiling) I don't remember the
              sun having a big 75 on it. (bounces
              off it and starts falling, landing

              saved my life. I've got to say something.

              right in line with the mascot. He
              starts to walk away and looks back.
              Says, "Huh" and turns back around
              to look at the mascot, then says "Nah"

              to the refrigerator, again in a position

              What would I say? I could really get
              in trouble. It's a bee law. You're
              not supposed to talk to a human. I
              can't believe I'm doing this. (begins
              debating with himself) I've got to.
              Oh, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes.
              No. Do it. I can't. How should I start
              it? "Ya like jazz?" No, that's no

              Hah, you're talking.

              I know. I'm– I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                        VANESSA
              No, it's okay. It's fine. It's just...
              I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall

              I'm not supposed to be doing this,

                        BARRY

                        BARRY
              Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't
              laugh, we'd cry with what we have

                        VANESSA
              Can I uh... get you something?

                        BARRY

                        VANESSA

                        BARRY
              Well, uh, I don't want to put you
              out, unless you're making it anyway.

                        VANESSA
              Oh, it's no trouble. Oh, it takes

                        BARRY
              Really?

                        VANESSA
              It's just coffee.

                        BARRY

              coffee onto the floor, a coffee cup

                        BARRY

              my hive right there. You can see it.

              Sorry I couldn't finis it. If I did,
              I'd be up for the rest of my life.

              it with her finger and they gingerly

              socket. It shorts, causing him to
              lose his balance and fall backwards.

              Our top story, a tri-county bee, Barry
              Benson is saying he intends to sue
              the human race for stealing our honey,
              packaging it, and profiting from it

              Larry, bees have never been afraid
              to change the world. I mean, what
              about Bee-Columbus? Bee-Ghandi? Be-geesus?

              Well, where I'm from, you wouldn't
              think of suing humans. We were thinking
              more like stick ball, uh, candy stores.

              How old are you?

                        BEE LARRY KING
              Well, I want you to know that they
              entire bee community is supporting
              you in this case, which is certain
              to be the trial of the bee century.

                        BARRY
              Thank you, Larry. You know, they have
              a Larry King in the human world, too.

              there's no trickery here. I'm just
              an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey's
              pretty important to me. It's important
              to all bees. We invented it, we make
              it, and we protect it with our lives.
              Unfortunately, there are some people
              in this room who think they can take
              whatever they want from us 'cause
              we're the little guys. And what I'm
              hoping is that after this is all over,
              you'll see how by taking our honey,

              disturbing term, I have to say. I
              don't imagine you employ any bee free-ers,

                        BARRY
              No. Because you don't free bees. You
              keep bees. And not only that, it seems
              you thought a bear would be an appropriate

              So, Mr. Sting. Thank you for being
              here. Your name intrigues me, I have
              to say. Where have I heard it before?

                        BARRY
              No, you haven't. And so, here we have

              No, I was just late. I tried to call.

              I didn't want all this to go to waste,
              so I called Barry. Luckily he was

              causing Ken to shake the bottle and
              get cider in his eyes. Barry grabs

              to stay with him, spins in place.
              There are flames outside the bathroom
              door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue,
              falls backward into the shower, pulling
              down the shower curtain. The can hits
              him in the head, followed by the shower
              curtain rod, and the rubber duck.

              shower head. He whips around, looking

              to do to turn this jury around is to

              The case of the honeybees versus the
              human race took a pointed turn against
              the bees yesterday when one of their
              legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

              has happened to bees who have never
              been asked, "Smoking or non?" Is this
              what nature intended for us? To be
              forcibly addicted to smoke machines
              and man-made wooden slat work camps?

              Alright Tournament of Roses, Pasadena,
              California. They've got nothing but
              flowers, floats and cotton candy.

                        BARRY
              Listen, everyone! This runway is covered
              with the last pollen from the last
              flowers available anywhere on Earth.
              That means this is our last chance.
              We're the only ones who make honey,
              pollinate flowers and dress like this.
              If we're gonna survive as a species,
              this is our moment! What do you say?
              Are we going to be bees, or just Museum

                        BEES
              We're bees!

                        BARRY
              Then everyone, follow me! Except Keychain.

              Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned
              this. (places a pollen jock jacket
              on Barry and the 3 pollen jocks cheer
              while Vanessa gives him a thumbs up)

              Yay!

                        BARRY
              I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
              fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
